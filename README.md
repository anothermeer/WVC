# WVC / WebVidComposer

WVC or WebVidComposer is a tool to download a movie from a m3u8 file. There are three versions of this tool, but I will put the shell script version first.

---

## Shell Script Version
To use the script, download from source and run this command

``` WVC.sh index.m3u8 ```

After running, just sit back, relax and see WVC in action.
